# Peribolos as a service

Learning exercise for OSG in how to make a managed service.

In this exercise we would like to take a [Peribolos](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/cmd/peribolos) tool and turn it into an automated, subscribable, and consumable service for declarative github organization management.
